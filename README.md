Game notes and ideas:
- allow the user to continue where they left off after leaving app and coming back
- Try to avoid popup ads unless they make a lot of money
- power ups are flags/pickups you need to hit while moving
- powerups also change player color?
- colored platforms that can only be used when you're that specific color
-wall jumping, wall riding?, gliding?, speed???
-underwater?
 - sinking, swimming
-space?
   -gravity is around "planets"
   - (Maybe!!!) move up or down by touching top or bottom of screen
   - slingshot off planet archs

-level with only wall jumps

GOALS:
- reach the end of each level
- collect coins to
   - upgrade powerups?
   - buy skins?
- "special coins"
   - fixed # per level, collecting them all gives you full completion of a map
